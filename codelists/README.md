# Code list repository

Here you will find code lists that can be used to identify:
- patients with specific conditions/characteristics
- medications prescribed

These code lists are free to reuse, but please acknowledge the relevant team as described for each individual list and in line with our licensing requirements (described below).

Code lists are organised in folders according to the dataset and type of list (e.g medications, diseases, demographics, etc.)

If you wish to contribute a code list you are very welcome to do so. Please provide information on how the list was created, who should be acknowledged for the work and, if possible, examples of publications using the list.
