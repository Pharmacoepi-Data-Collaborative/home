# CPRD Gold and Aurum code list for opioids

This code list was developed by Annie Jeffery, Division of Psychiatry, UCL.

The list was developed by searching the CPRD product dictionary "drugsubstance" variable, for terms matching opioids in the [BNF Chapter 4.7.2](https://openprescribing.net/bnf/040702/).

There are separate files for CPRD Gold (opioidCodesA) and Aurum (opioidCodesG)

When you load the files, ensure you read the product code columns as character variables.
