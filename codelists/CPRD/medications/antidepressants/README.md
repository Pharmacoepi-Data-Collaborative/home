# CPRD code lists for antidepressants

This code lists was developed by Annie Jeffery, Division of Psychiatry, UCL.

The list was developed by searching the CPRD product dictionary "drugsubstance" variable, for terms matching antidepressants which have been licensed to treat depression in the UK since the year 2000.

The file contains productcodes for CPRD Gold and Aurum - the relevant database is indicated in the "Database" column.

When you load the files, ensure you read the medcode and medcodeid variables as characters.

This list have been used in the following research:
