Here you will find code lists that can be used to identify:
- patients with specific health conditions

Where available, information on how the code list has been created, comparison to other existing code lists and references to research using the code lists will be provided.

These code lists are free to reuse, but please acknowledge the relevant team as described for each individual list and in line with our licensing requirements (described below).

Other resources for health condition code lists in CPRD Gold can be found here:

- [HDRUK Phenotype Library](https://phenotypes.healthdatagateway.org/phenotypes/?)

If you wish to contribute a code list you are very welcome to do so. Please provide information on how the list was created, who should be acknowledged for the work and, if possible, examples of publications using the list. 

Thank you! :)
