# CPRD code lists for anxiety

These code lists were developed by researchers from the Division of Psychiatry, Primary Care and Population Health and the Institute of Health Informatics, UCL.

There is a separate list for CPRD Gold and CPRD Aurum. In CPRD data, the variables medcode (Gold) and medcodeid (Aurum) can be used to identify records relating to anxiety.

When you load the files, ensure you read the medcode and medcodeid variables as characters.
