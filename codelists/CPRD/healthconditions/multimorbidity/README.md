# CPRD (Gold and Aurum) code lists for multimorbidity

These code lists were adapted for CPRD Aurum and Gold by Naomi Launders, Division of Psychiatry, UCL.

These lists were generated for the CPRD based on [code lists developed by Metcalf et al](https://bmcmedresmethodol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12874-019-0753-5) for identifying clinical conditions from two frequently used comorbidity measures: the Charlson Comorbidity Index and the Elixhauser Method. 

The Charlson Comorbidity Index was created in 1987 to predict in-hospital mortality in people with multimorbidity. It includes 19 condition categories, weighted according to severity (in terms of predicting mortality). More information can be found [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0021968187901718?via%3Dihub).

The Elixhauser Method was created in 1998 to predict in-hospital mortality, length of stay, adverse events and discharges. It includes 30 condition categories, weighted according to severity (in terms of predicting hospital outcomes). More information can be found [here](https://journals.lww.com/lww-medicalcare/Fulltext/1998/01000/Comorbidity_Measures_for_Use_with_Administrative.4.aspx).

When you load the files, ensure you read the medcode and medcodeid variables as characters.

There are separate lists for Charlson and Elixhauser, and for CPRD Gold and Aurum. The lists contain lookup codes (medcode, medcodeid) for CPRD, readcodes, SNOMED codes (Aurum only), terms that describe the code (e.g. COPD annual review), the condition group (e.g. COPD), and the comorbidity index score.

These lists have been used in the following research:
