# Confounding by indication

At our December 2022 Winter Meeting we will be discussing the issue of confounding by indication in the context of polypharmacy. 

The following page describes the issue, and the discussion items for the workshop. At the end of the workshop we will be adding notes from the discussion. We then invite users to contribute resources on methods used to address this key problem in pharmacoepidemiology. We will be offering a voucher worth £50 to £100 for the best contribution! More details below... :)

## Background on pharmacoepi research in polypharmacy

Polypharmacy is described by the King’s Fund as a “the concomitant use of multiple medications by one individual”. For many people, the use of multiple medications can be essential for extending life expectancy and improving quality of life. However, when medications are prescribed inappropriately, polypharmacy can be problematic. There is a growing body of evidence showing that polypharmacy can increase an individual’s risk of drug side effects, drug-drug or drug-disease interactions, treatment burden, poor quality of life and non-adherence to medications. However, there is also conflicting evidence that people who take more medications may have better engagement with care and better adherence to treatments. 

Strict inclusion criteria and the complex characteristics of people who use multiple medications make the effects of polypharmacy difficult to study in clinical trials. This makes polypharmacy an important area for research using real-world data and pharmacoepi methods. However, a key problem when studying the effects of polypharmacy in real-world data is confounding by indication.

## The problem of confounding by indication

Confounding by indication occurs when the observed effect of a medication is not caused by the medication itself, but by the condition for which the medication is prescribed. In the case of polypharmacy, observed outcomes such as adverse effects, poor adherence, or poor quality of life, may in fact be a result of multimorbidity (either specific conditions or the cumulative burden of multiple conditions), rather than the medications themselves. As the condition for which a medication is prescribed is likely to be highly correlated with the prescribing of the medication, adjusting for the condition as a confounder may cause overfitting of our models, and not resolve the issue of confounding by indication. On the other hand, clinical characteristics that might lead to the prescribing of a medication, such as disease severity, may not be available in the data, and so may lead to unmeasured confounding by indication. 

## Key questions to address in our workshop

1) Where might confounding by indication (i.e. the effect of multimorbidity vs the effect of polypharmacy) be an issue in polyparmacy pharmacoepi research? Do you have any experience of this?

2) How can we address this problem?

## Post-workshop contribution competition

**Do you know any examples methods that can adequately address confounding by indication in pharmacoepi research using secondary data?**

We are offering vouchers of £50-100 for the best contribution to these pages of examples of how confounding by indication has been addressed in pharmacoepi research using secondary data. The vouchers are redeemable at a number of major online UK retailers. The contributions should meet these criteria:
