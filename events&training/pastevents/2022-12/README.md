## Winter Meeting Report December 2022

Thank you for everyone who attended and contributed to our Winter Meeting. We had 47 attendees for a highly informative session with lots of great discussion. 100% of attendees who completed our feedback poll said that they enjoed the event and that they were encouraged them to carry out further pharmacoepi research.

### Key note talk

Thank you to Professor Reecha Sofat for presenting her work on *Using Data Science to improve the use of medicines - an insight from medicines analytics across the UK*. Professor Reecha Sofat is the Breckenridge Chair in Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Head of Department for Pharmacology and Therapeutics at the University of Liverpool and Clinical Vice President of the British Pharmacological Society. Reecha talked to us about harnessing UK-wide prescription and dispensing records for pharmacoepidemiological research. Her first example described a study of the decline in new antihypertensive prescriptions during the pandemic and its potential cardiovascular disease ramifications. Then Reecha discussed a study of prevalent and incident prescriptions of the teratogenic anti-epileptic/ mood-stabilising drug Sodium Valproate in women of child-bearing age. She used this example to highlight regional inequities in alerts for potentially harmful prescribing, before summarising the overarching benefits and challenges of using this data. 

### Launch of the Polypharmacy Data Collaborative's Online Knowledge Hub

Today we launched these Github pages and gave attendees a whistlestop tour. 100% of attendees who completed our feedback poll said they would use the Knowledge Hub. We hope it provides a valuable resource and that many of you will also consider contributing. Some key features that people would most like to see developed are:
- Statistical/data management code (90%)
- Code lists (80%)
- Methods tutorials (80%)
- Info on pharm-epi courses/conferences (70%)
- Info on data sources (50%)
- Collaboration opportunities (50%)
- Problem-solving forum (50%)

### Problem solving workshop - confounding by indication for polypharmacy

We discussed how confounding by indication can be a major issue for pharmacoepi research in polypharmacy. More details of the workshop with notes from the discussion can be found [here](https://github.com/Pharmacoepi-Data-Collaborative/home/blob/Main/events%26training/workshops/confounding_by_indication.md). We are invite you to contribute knowledge on methods to address confounding by indication, and are offering a Â£50-100 voucher prize for the best contribution. Details of how to contribute can be found [here](https://github.com/Pharmacoepi-Data-Collaborative/home/blob/Main/events%26training/workshops/confounding_by_indication.md)
