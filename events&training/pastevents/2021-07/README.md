## Workshop summary: Issues of medication adherence and its measurement 
In small groups, we discussed some of the issues surrounding medication adherence and it’s measurement. The extent of the problem was discussed, and the importance of maintaining good, trusting clinician/ patient relationships in promoting adherence. Additionally, it was acknowledged that using metrics gleaned from electronic health records data, e.g. the medication possession ratio (MPR) and the proportion of days covered (PDC), may be a poor proxy for adherence as it does not account for prescriptions not being collected or for medication being hoarded or disposed of by patients.
