# Event report - Winter Meeting December 2012

## Keynote talk: Dr Alex Walker, epidemiologist at The DataLab in Oxford
Bio: *"I’ve previously worked with electronic health record data such as CPRD/HES before coming to Oxford 5 years ago. Our team at The Datalab is focused on making health research and NHS analytics more open, reproducible and robust. We’ve been working on OpenSAFELY.org since March 2020."*
Many thanks to Dr Alex Walker for the fantastic keynote talk – we hope it has inspired you to think about new ways of using electronic health records and perhaps using OpenSAFELY. He has kindly provided the following links where people can read more about OpenSAFELY:

## Workshop summary: “Pharmaco-epi knowledge hub – rapid requirements gathering and live wireframe co-production” (see also attached slides)
Firstly, Annie talked to us about the rationale for an online pharmacoepi knowledge hub and our vision for the Hub. Then we split into breakout rooms to discuss what we wanted to see in the Hub, then re-convened as a whole group to feedback to each other on this topic. Ideas were broadly grouped into: codelists, databases, syntax, resources, forum and collaborations (see attached slides). Following this, Annie presented some discussion areas for potential requirements of the Hub (e.g. should it be private vs. public, who should curate the content etc) and we divided into breakout rooms again to discuss these further. After this, we got together one final time to discuss what we thought the requirements should be for each of the broad categories of content listed above (see attached slides). We’re very grateful to everyone who participated for their enthusiasm and ideas. Work on the Hub has now begun in earnest so watch this space!
