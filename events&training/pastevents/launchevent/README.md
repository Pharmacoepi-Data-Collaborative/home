# Launch event report

Thank you to everyone who supported our first event! We had 61 senior and early career researchers participate from a range of backgrounds and universities.  

Our keynote speaker, Professor Irene Petersen, showcased the “self-controlled case series” method. You can read more about this method [here:](https://www.bmj.com/content/354/bmj.i4515)

There were 3 excellent entries to the “5 Minute Methods” competition including projects using a range of global healthcare databases  - congratulations to Kenneth Man the Research Department of Practice and Policy, at UCL’s School of Pharmacy, who won the competition for his entry entitled “The use of negative control in pharmaco-epidemiological study”. Details of Kenneth’s study can be viewed [here:](https://github.com/ohdsi-studies/Corazon)

The problem-solving workshop exploring issues with analysing prescriptions with multiple indications generated a productive discussion – including the following suggestions to identify probable prescribing indications:
- Dose and/or duration
- Diagnostic codes before and after prescription
- Excluding people with diagnostic codes for other indications
- Clustering with other medications
- Algorithmic/ propensity score approach
