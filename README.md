# UCL Pharmacoepi Data Collaborative
## Welcome to the UCL Pharmacoepi Data Collaborative's Online Knowledge Hub!

We are a network of researchers from UCL and beyond who use pharmacoepidemiology methods with secondary datasets. 

We currently host termly online events with expert speakers, research competitions & problem-solving workshops. 

On these pages, you will find our online knowledge hub - a resource for pharmacoepi researchers to share knowledge and code. We will also post learning materials, collaboration opportunities and details of our events on these pages. 

#### What is pharmacoepi?

The use of big data sets, such as large UK primary care databases like Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) and  The Health Improvement Network (THIN), is increasing among health researchers, as they provide a unique opportunity to work with large sample sizes (CPRD has over 50 million patients). Prescriptions are often one of the best coded areas in electronic health care records, and therefore they are growing in use amongst researchers to answer key health research questions. Pharmacoepi analysis in big datasets is often complex, with challenges unique to this area of data analysis, this includes: challenges with analysing dosing and duration, different preparations of medicines, understanding prescription use and compliance, establishing definitions for “long term” use of prescriptions. There is not a standard approach for preparing prescription data from electronic health records – this alone can often take months of trial and error.
