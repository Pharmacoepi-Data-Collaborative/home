# How to contribute?

Thank you for taking the time to contribute to this project. üéâ

We have used a template from the **Reproducible Project Template** repository, developed under ***[The Turing Way](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way)* to demonstrate the practical integration of reproducibility practices on the collaborative or shared online repository**.

This project is being developed **openly** and invites contributions from **anyone interested** in reproducible data science for pharmacoepidemiology who would like to get involved.
You can suggest topics to include in this repository, report mistakes/bugs, create Pull Requests to fix an error, offer resources or help develop or review the  materials.
We have a [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) that applies to all the activities related to this project.

‚≠êÔ∏è You are acknowledged for all kinds of contributions
---
In this repository, we use the [All Contributors Bot](https://allcontributors.org/) that help us recognise all contributors, even when they don't directly contribute on the repository.
You can find all [emoji/Type keywords](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/emoji-key) representing the types of contribution. 
To add a contributor, comment on Issue or Pull Request (where the contributor is involved) using this message for @all-contributors:
`@all-contributors please add @<username> for <keyword in the Type column>`

## Whatever is your availability, there is a way to contribute to this GitHub repository.

üëã I'm busy, I only have 5 minute
---

Look through our currently open [issues](../../issues) to contribute to requested resources, troubleshoot an issue or participate in an ongoing discussion by commenting.

Do you have code lists to contribute but not confident using Github? You can email these directly to us for uploading by emailing [annie.jeffery.09@ucl.ac.uk](mailto:annie.jeffery.09@ucl.ac.uk). Please explain the purpose of the lists, how they were developed (including by whom) and links to examples of where they have been used for pharmacoepidemiology research.

You can also share this repository with someone who might be interested to get involved.

‚è≥ I've got 15 minutes - tell me what I should do

You can read our [README](./README.md) file to find details and the next milestones in the project.

You can also read different issues in this repository and comment where you would like to be involved.

Do you have code lists, data management code or statistical code to contribute, but are not confident using Github? You can email any contributions to [annie.jeffery.09@ucl.ac.uk](mailto:annie.jeffery.09@ucl.ac.uk). Please ensure the code is annotated (for data management or statistical code), and for all code provide information on how/why it was developed (including by whom) and links to examples of where they have been used for pharmacoepidemiology research. 

üéâ It's my life's mission to enable reproducibility in data science and research
---

Please share feedback on the contents proposed for sharing learning on pharmacoepidemiology research using secondary datasets.

You are encouraged to review the material as we collaboratively develop them and get involved where you can.

Please open a GitHub issue to suggest a new topic, contribute code/resources, or let us know about errors/bugs.

üõ† I am ready to contribute

- For open tasks in this repository, please see the [Issues section](../../issues).
-   Start work on a contribution that is already listed as an issue or something you‚Äôve already discussed by opening a [Pull Request](../../pulls)
  - Read details on [how to open a Pull Request](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/#opening-a-pull-request)
  - A Pull Request doesn‚Äôt have to represent finished work. It‚Äôs usually better to open a Pull Request early on, so others can watch or give feedback on your progress. Just mark it as a ‚ÄúWIP‚Äù (Work in Progress) in the subject line. You can always add more commits later
- Raise mistakes, errors or missing information on this repository by opening a [Pull Request](../../pulls)
  - Submit trivial fixes (for example, a typo, a broken link or an obvious error)
- Raise a new issue to suggest a contribution not already listed
- If you would like to submit code lists, data management code, statistical code, or any learning materials but are not confident with the above methods, please reach out to **Annie Jeffery by emailing [annie.jeffery.09@ucl.ac.uk](mailto:annie.jeffery.09@ucl.ac.uk)**.
